What This Article Adds: Oculomotor dysfunction seems to improve during inpatient TBI rehabilitation with remedial treatment. Best practice in occupational therapy has not yet been established.", "An appropriately powered RCT could positively contribute  to the evidence available to clinicians.", "Visual impairments are common after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Studies estimate that as many as 90% of people with TBI experience injury-related vision impairments (Ciuffreda et al., 2007), of which 56%\u201380% are oculomotor (Ciuffreda et al., 2007; Schlageter et al., 1993). The oculomotor system has representation in all brain lobes, making eye movements easily impaired as a result of TBI (Baker & Epstein, 1991; Helvie, 2011; Leigh & Zee, 2006). Eye movements include pursuits, saccades, vestibular ocular reflex, convergence, and fixations (Leigh & Zee, 2006). Oculomotor impairments can negatively affect activities of daily living such as reading, computing, and community participation (Ciuffreda et al., 2007; Kapoor & Ciuffreda, 2002; Warren, 1993a). Evaluation and treatment of oculomotor impairments are key to improving functional vision in TBI rehabilitation (Warren, 1993a, 1993b). Both remedial protocols and compensatory interventions can be used (Powell & Torgerson, 2011; Warren 1993a, 1993b). Little evidence exists to assist clinicians with a reliable remedial protocol for impaired oculomotor skills in this population. Published literature on vision rehabilitation after TBI primarily provides Level II and III evidence, is typically older than 5 yr, and frequently involves people with mild TBI or stroke (Berger et al., 2016; Kapoor & Ciuffreda, 2002; Riggs et al., 2007). The two protocols used in this study reflect a remedial approach to oculomotor treatment (Powell & Torgerson, 2011; Warren, 1993b). The Six Eye Exercises (SEE) protocol is informed by exercises in the literature that emphasize direct eye movement practice (Ciuffreda & Ludlam, 2009; Kapoor & Ciuffreda, 2002). Each eye movement described by Leigh and Zee (2006) is included. The SEE protocol reflects a bottom-up approach to oculomotor treatment (Powell & Torgerson, 2011) and has been used by clinicians in the study facility with anecdotal success. The standard-of-care (SOC) control protocol emphasizes activity-based eye movement practice frequently used by occupational therapy practitioners (Powell & Torgerson, 2011; Raymond et al., 1996; Warren, 1993a, 1993b; Zoltan, 2007). Activities and occupations that integrate eye movements, such as scanning and reading, are included.", "The SOC protocol reflects a top-down approach to oculomotor treatment (Powell & Torgerson, 2011). Formally comparing these two protocols could help determine whether a top-down or bottom-up approach to remedial oculomotor treatment is most effective in TBI rehabilitation. This pilot study was designed to examine the process, resources, management, and scientific validity (Thabane et al., 2010) for conducting an appropriately powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a direct exercise protocol for oculomotor rehabilitation after TBI."], "Method": ["Research Design A two-group RCT design was used.", "The study was approved by the HCA Healthcare HealthONE (Denver, CO) institutional review board. Instruments The primary outcome measure, the Craig Hospital Eye Examination Rating Scale (CHEERS), measures the severity of  oculomotor impairments. It is an eye movement rating scale that examines smooth pursuit saccades, vestibular ocular re\ufb02ex, vergence, and \ufb01xation and nystagmus. Interrater reliability was reported as strong, and test\u2013 retest reliability was   reported as moderate (Politzer et al., 2017).", "A higher CHEERS score means greater impairment. Several secondary outcome measures were used to determine the functional impact of oculomotor impairments: n    For saccadic speed and accuracy, the King\u2013 Devick Test (K\u2013 DT; Lieberman et al., 1983), a rapid number naming test that measures saccades, was used. K\u2013 DT test\u2013 retest reliability and sensitivity to changes in reading \ufb02uency   and comprehension are reported as strong (Dodick et al., 2017; Heick et al., 2016).", "Slower speed and more errors  mean greater impairment. n    For scanning speed and accuracy, the Delis\u2013 Kaplan Executive Function System (D\u2013 KEFS; Delis et al., 2001)  Trail Making Test: Condition 1 Visual Scanning, a number cancellation test, was used. Test\u2013 retest reliability is .56.", "Slower speed and more errors mean greater scanning impairment. n    For reading speed and accuracy, the Nelson\u2013 Denny Reading Test (NDRT; Brown et al., 1993): Subtest 1, a reading screening instrument that measures reading rate, was used. Test\u2013 retest reliability for the NDRT reading  rate is modest (Rudner, 1991).", "A modi\ufb01ed version of Subtest 1 was used. Participants read the passage aloud versus silently for 1 minto enable evaluators to monitor reading errors.", "Fewer words read and more errors mean   greater impairment. n    For subjective symptoms, the Vision Symptom Scale (VSS), an 11-symptom self-report Likert scale (from 0 to 4) developed for this study to monitor subjective symptom frequency and severity, was used. It was administered immediately after the NDRT to characterize reading-induced symptoms.", "Psychometric properties were not established because of time frames for trial completion.", "A higher score means more severe symptoms. Participants Consecutive admissions to the inpatient TBI program at a single Colorado-based rehabilitation hospital were screened  for eligibility by their primary occupational therapist within 72 hr of admission. All patients with TBI who were ages   18\u201365 yr were screened for eligibility. Patients were eligible if they had any impairment of visual \ufb01xation, pursuits,    saccades, vestibular ocular re\ufb02ex, or convergence. People with oculomotor impairment were excluded from enrollment  if they had a projected inpatient stay of less than 6 wk, could not see stimuli during oculomotor screening, could not use at least one arm, could not follow a standard three-step instruction, could not sustain attention for a 30-min treatment   session, or were participating in another clinical trial. After giving consent, eligible participants were enrolled in the   experimental SEE group or the control SOC group by a masked statistician according to a randomization schedule. Participants were masked to group assignment.", "Procedures All participants underwent a baseline vision evaluation by a rehabilitation optometrist who was masked to group assignment. The optometrist performed the CHEERS, an acuity check, and an eye health examination on site.", "Compensatory lenses for acuity and double vision were prescribed as indicated.", "An investigator was present at all initial evaluations with the optometrist. Within 1\u201324 hr of the vision evaluation, participants completed a baseline    functional evaluation in a quiet room with one of two occupational therapists who were uniformly trained on administering the secondary outcome measures and who were masked to group assignment. Recommended compensatory lenses from the vision evaluation were not used during baseline functional testing, because the lenses  had not been made in time. Lenses worn before injury were used if available.", "Meetings were held with the evaluators at monthly intervals to maintain consistency with evaluation performance. During the treatment phase, all SEE group and SOC group participants received their regular therapies, including vision interventions that fell within SOC occupational therapy as directed by their primary occupational therapist. Participants received 30 min of additional 1:1 vision treatment, according to their group assignment, 5 days per week  for 4 wk. One of four nonevaluator occupational therapists, who were uniformly trained in one of the speci\ufb01c protocols, performed the treatment.", "The treating occupational therapists were masked to the protocol being used in the other treatment group.", "Monthly meetings were held to review protocols.", "Participants used recommended compensatory   lenses, once obtained, for acuity and double vision during treatment sessions. The SEE protocol included six exercises: eye stretches,tracking, gaze stabilization, spatial localization, saccades,  and vergence.", "Eye stretches and four of the remaining \ufb01ve exercises were performed in each treatment session. The SOC protocol included activities that integrate oculomotor skills under four categories: visual\u2013motor, scanning, visual   cognition, and reading. At least one activity from each category and 5 min of reading were performed in each treatment  session.", "After completing their respective 4-wk protocols, each participant was retested on all primary and secondary outcome measures according to the pretesting procedure. Participants in both groups used their corrective   lenses for acuity and double vision during posttreatment testing. Participants had to complete 16 of 20 allotted therapy  sessions for data to be maintained for analysis.", "Participants were paid $25 for each completed pre- and posttesting session.

Primary Outcome At baseline, the SOC group CHEERS total indicated that this group was more impaired than the SEE group (Table 2).", "Impairment was most frequently noted on the Smooth Pursuit subscale of CHEERS (100%). Both groups improved on CHEERS, with the SOC group exhibiting greater average change (Table 3). On the Smooth Pursuit subscale, more in the SEE group (38%) reached an unimpaired score than in the SOC group (17%). Secondary Outcomes At baseline, 100% of the participants reported visual symptoms on the VSS. The SEE group reported a greater average number and severity of symptoms than the SOC group (Table 2). Posttreatment, the number and severity of symptoms improved in both groups, with the SEE group exhibiting a greater reduction in average number of symptoms (Table 3).Posttreatment, 38% of the SEE group was asymptomatic compared with 17% of the SOC group. Reading rate on the NDRT was similar for both groups at baseline (Table 2).", "Both groups improved at posttreatment, with the SEE group exhibiting a greater average improvement in reading speed (Table 3). The SEE group was slightly slower on the D\u2013KEFS Visual Scanning test at baseline and exhibited greater average improvement posttreatment (Table 3).", "The SEE group was also slightly slower on the K\u2013DT at baseline and exhibited slightly greater average improvement posttreatment (Table 3). Discussion Participants in both groups improved in functional status over the course of treatment, indicating that oculomotor intervention could be helpful and is not harmful in TBI rehabilitation (Bergeret al., 2016; Ciuffreda & Ludlam, 2009; Kapoor & Ciuffreda, 2002; Powell & Torgerson, 2011;Raymond et al., 1996; Riggs et al., 2007;Schlageter et al., 1993; Warren, 1993a, 1993b). Even though participants in the SEE group had more symptoms at baseline than those in the SOC group, a larger percentage of the SEE participants reported improvement and resolution of their disruptive visual symptoms during reading without extra reading practice. Further study could reveal clinical usefulness of bottom-up direct practice using the SEE protocol along with more traditional top-down activity-based practice in occupational therapy treatment of vision impairments in people with TBI (Powell & Torgerson, 2011).

For small pilot studies, allocation by minimization to more closely match the groups on severity of injury and impairments is suggested. Another limitation involved the use of lenses for acuity and double vision.", "Two participants in each group needed special lenses to compensate for double vision. The lenses were not used during pretesting because they had not yet been obtained,but they were used during posttesting because the participants had used them throughout the duration of their treatment. It is dif\ufb01cult to determine whether these participants improved from the treatment, the lenses, or both.", "A plan for quickly dispensing lenses for pretesting is recommended. The diffuse nature of TBIs and the natural healing that occurs during acute rehabilitation make it difficult to at tribute improvements to treatment alone. In an appropriately powered study, we suggest using statistical analyses to determine more closely what factors can be attributed to improvements outside of treatment. More sensitive oculomotor testing for a primary outcome measure could improve objective measurement; a computerized pursuit test, for example, could reduce errors. In the future, a third treatment group that receives 15 min of SEE treatment and 15 min of SOC treatment is recommended.", "This combination treatment would allow evaluation of the efficacy of using both direct bottom-up and activity-based top-down practices.", "A fourth group that does not receive extra treatment could be considered.", "Applying this methodology to an outpatient population after a period of natural healing has happened may also strengthen validity. Finally, this study design could also be used with people with concussion and mild TBI to determine efficacy of oculomotor interventions in populations with these conditions.", "", "\\begin{table}[h!] \\centering \\caption{Table 2.
